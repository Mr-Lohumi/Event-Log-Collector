# Event Log Collector Script

## Overview

This PowerShell script collects System and Application event logs from the last 24 hours, filtering for errors and warnings. It displays the logs in the console and optionally exports them to a CSV file.

## Features

- Retrieves error and warning logs from both System and Application event logs.
- Collects logs from the last 24 hours.
- Outputs logs to the console with details like log name, entry type, source, event ID, message, and timestamp.
- Optionally exports logs to a CSV file.

## Requirements

- PowerShell (v5.0 or later)
- Proper permissions to access event logs

## How to Use

2. **Export logs**:
   - The script automatically exports the logs to `C:\EventLogs.csv` by default. You can modify the file path in the script as needed.
